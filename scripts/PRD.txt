# Overview
This project is a web-based chess application that allows users to play chess against a computer opponent. The application focuses on providing a seamless experience where users can maintain multiple ongoing games and continue them at any time. The primary value proposition is the ability to save game states and resume play later, making it perfect for users who enjoy playing chess but may not have time to complete games in a single sitting.

# Core Features

1. User Authentication
   - JWT-based authentication system
   - Simple login/logout functionality
   - Secure session management
   - Why: Enables personal game tracking and state persistence
   - How: Spring Boot backend with JWT tokens, AngularJS frontend handling auth state

2. Chess Game Interface
   - Interactive chess board
   - Legal move validation
   - Computer opponent moves
   - Game state visualization
   - Why: Core gameplay functionality
   - How: AngularJS chess board component with move validation logic

3. Game State Management
   - Automatic save after each move
   - List of in-progress games
   - Ability to resume any saved game
   - Why: Enables the key differentiating feature of game persistence
   - How: MySQL database storing game states, REST API for state management

# User Experience

User Personas:
1. Casual Chess Player
   - Wants to play chess in short sessions
   - Needs ability to save and resume games
   - Prefers simple, straightforward interface

2. Learning Player
   - Wants to practice against computer

   - Makes moves on chess board
   - Game state automatically saved
   - Can leave and return at any time

UI/UX Considerations:
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Clear visual feedback for moves and game state
- Intuitive navigation between games

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical Challenges:
1. Chess Engine Complexity
   - Risk: Implementing correct chess rules and computer opponent
   - Mitigation: Use established chess libraries, start with basic computer opponent

2. State Management
   - Risk: Race conditions in game state updates
   - Mitigation: Implement proper locking and validation

3. Performance
   - Risk: Slow game state loading/saving
   - Mitigation: Efficient state serialization, proper indexing

MVP Considerations:
1. Scope Control
   - Risk: Feature creep
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP features

2. Technical Debt
